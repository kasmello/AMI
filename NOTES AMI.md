## lecture 1: Intelligent Agents:

AI - entity that perceives and acts

PEAS

P - performance Measure
E - Environment
A - Actuators
S - Sensors

Describing the problem of the environment:

* Fully Observable/Partially Observable
* Single Agent/Multi Agent
* Deterministic/Sctochastic
* Episodic/Sequential
* Static/Dynamic - if environment can change itself while agent is deliberating
* discrete/continuous - discrete has finite set of possibilities (e.g. chess)

Types of agents:
* Utility based agent
* goal based agent
* model-based agent - takes in how the world evolves to adapt actions of AI
* simple reflex agent

## Exam Preparation notes

Exam 2017:

Question 2: ii

Answer: Recursive Best First Search
        -memory efficient
        -can use heuristic
        -can be used to get out of labyrinth


Question 8:

* a Answer: Vx Vy ( Hero(x) ˄ Name(x,Link) ˄ (x!=y) ) => Save(x,World) ˄ ⌐Save(y,World) THE LAST PART MEANS ONLY

* b Answer: Vx Student(x) ˄ Works(x,Hard) => Pass(x,COMP3006)

Disadvantages of Frame and Effect:

    one axiom per action needed - large branching factor and memory needed


However Successor state axioms are more memory efficient (need to clarify)
